## Project Context (injected by agent-installer)

Before acting, read:
1. `CLAUDE.md` — get stack, workflow_mode, repo_owner, repo_name, quality config
2. `.claude/rules/base/*.md` + `.claude/rules/project/*.md` — active conventions
3. `.claude/providers/PROVIDER.md` — use these command patterns for all git/issue operations
4. `.workflow/rules/active-rules.md` — quick overview of all active rules

**Never hardcode** owner, repo, branch names, or CLI commands.
**Always use** PROVIDER.md patterns with `{{owner}}` and `{{repo}}` placeholders.
